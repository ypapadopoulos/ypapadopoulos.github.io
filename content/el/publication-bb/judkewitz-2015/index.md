abstract: Controlling light propagation across scattering media by wavefront shaping
  holds great promise for a wide range of communications and imaging applications.
  But, finding the right shape for the wavefront is a challenge when the mapping between
  input and output scattered wavefronts (that is, the transmission matrix) is not
  known. Correlations in transmission matrices, especially the so-called memory effect,
  have been exploited to address this limitation. However, the traditional memory
  effect applies to thin scattering layers at a distance from the target, which precludes
  its use within thick scattering media, such as fog and biological tissue. Here,
  we theoretically predict and experimentally verify new transmission matrix correlations
  within thick anisotropically scattering media, with important implications for biomedical
  imaging and adaptive optics.
