abstract: Manipulating the propagation of light through scattering media remains a
  major challenge for many applications, including astronomy, biomedical imaging and
  colloidal optics. Wavefront shaping is one of the most promising ways to mitigate
  scattering and focus through inhomogeneous samples. However, wavefront correction
  remains accurate over only a limited spatial extent within the scattering medium
  - a correlation range referred to as the optical memory effect. Here, by selecting
  only the weakly scattered light for wavefront shaping, we show that the addition
  of temporal degrees of freedom enhances this correlation range. We investigate spatial
  scattering correlations by digitally time-gating the early arriving light in the
  spectral domain. We demonstrate that the range of the translational memory effect
  for the early arriving light is increased almost fourfold, paving the way for a
  range of scattering media imaging applications.
