abstract: Light propagation through multimode fibers suffers from spatial distortions
  that lead to a scrambled intensity profile. In previous work, the correction of
  such distortions using various wavefront control methods has been demonstrated in
  the continuous wave case. However, in the ultra-fast pulse regime, modal dispersion
  temporally broadens a pulse after propagation. Here, we present a method that compensates
  for spatial distortions and mitigates temporal broadening due to modal dispersion
  by a selective phase conjugation process in which only modes of similar group velocities
  are excited. The selectively excited modes are forced to follow certain paths through
  the multimode fiber and interfere constructively at the distal tip to form a focused
  spot with minimal temporal broadening. We demonstrate the delivery of focused 500
  fs pulses through a 30 cm long step-index multimode fiber. The achieved pulse duration
  corresponds to approximately 1/30th of the duration obtained if modal dispersion
  was not controlled. Moreover, we measured a detailed two-dimensional map of the
  pulse duration at the output of the fiber and confirmed that the focused spot produces
  a two-photon absorption effect. This work opens new possibilities for ultra-thin
  multiphoton imaging through multimode fibers.
