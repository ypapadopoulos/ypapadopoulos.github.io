abstract: The optical memory effect is a well-known type of wave correlation that
  is observed in coherent fields that scatter through thin and diffusive materials,
  like biological tissue. It is a fundamental physical property of scattering media
  that can be harnessed for deep-tissue microscopy or 'through-the-wall' imaging applications.
  Here we show that the optical memory effect is a special case of a far more general
  class of wave correlation. Our new theoretical framework explains how waves remain
  correlated over both space and angle when they are jointly shifted and tilted inside
  scattering media of arbitrary geometry. We experimentally demonstrate the existence
  of such coupled correlations and describe how they can be used to optimize the scanning
  range in adaptive optics microscopes.
