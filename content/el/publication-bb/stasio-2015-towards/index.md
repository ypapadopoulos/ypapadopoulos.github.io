abstract: In this paper we demonstrate the enhancement of the sensing capabilities
  of glass capillaries. We exploit their properties as optical and acoustic waveguides
  to transform them potentially into high resolution minimally invasive endoscopic
  devices. We show two possible applications of silica capillary waveguides demonstrating
  fluorescence and optical-resolution photoacoustic imaging using a single 330 μm-thick
  silica capillary. A nanosecond pulsed laser is focused and scanned in front of a
  capillary by digital phase conjugation through the silica annular ring of the capillary,
  used as an optical waveguide. We demonstrate optical-resolution photoacoustic images
  of a 30 μm-thick nylon thread using the water-filled core of the same capillary
  as an acoustic waveguide, resulting in a fully passive endoscopic device. Moreover,
  fluorescence images of 1.5 μm beads are obtained collecting the fluorescence signal
  through the optical waveguide. This kind of silica-capillary waveguide together
  with wavefront shaping techniques such as digital phase conjugation, paves the way
  to minimally invasive multi-modal endoscopy.
