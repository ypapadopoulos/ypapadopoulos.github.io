abstract: Optical imaging techniques are widely used in biological research, but their
  penetration depth is limited by tissue scattering. Wavefront shaping techniques
  are able to overcome this problem in principle, but are often slow and their performance
  depends on the sample. This greatly reduces their practicability for biological
  applications. Here we present a scattering compensation technique based on three-photon
  (3P) excitation, which converges faster than comparable two-photon (2P) techniques
  and works reliably even on densely labeled samples, where 2P approaches fail. To
  demonstrate its usability and advantages for biomedical imaging we apply it to the
  imaging of dendritic spines on GFP-labeled layer 5 neurons in an anesthetized mouse.
