abstract: We describe a method for imaging 3D objects in a tomographic configuration
  implemented by training an artificial neural network to reproduce the complex amplitude
  of the experimentally measured scattered light. The network is designed such that
  the voxel values of the refractive index of the 3D object are the variables that
  are adapted during the training process. We demonstrate the method experimentally
  by forming images of the 3D refractive index distribution of cells.
