abstract: Acquiring high-contrast optical images deep inside biological tissues is
  still a challenging problem. Confocal microscopy is an important tool for biomedical
  imaging since it improves image quality by rejecting background signals. However,
  it suffers from low sensitivity in deep tissues due to light scattering. Recently,
  multimode fibers have provided a new paradigm for minimally invasive endoscopic
  imaging by controlling light propagation through them. Here we introduce a combined
  imaging technique where confocal images are acquired through a multimode fiber.
  We achieve this by digitally engineering the excitation wavefront and then applying
  a virtual digital pinhole on the collected signal. In this way, we are able to acquire
  images through the fiber with significantly increased contrast. With a fiber of
  numerical aperture 0.22, we achieve a lateral resolution of 1.5µm, and an axial
  resolution of 12.7µm. The point-scanning rate is currently limited by our spatial
  light modulator (20Hz).
