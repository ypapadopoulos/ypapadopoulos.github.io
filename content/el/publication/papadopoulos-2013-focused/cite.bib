 abstract = {We demonstrate for the first time to our knowledge a digital phase conjugation technique for generating a sharp focus point at the end of a multimode optical fiber. A sharp focus with a contrast of 1800 is experimentally obtained at the tip of a 105 Î¼m core multimode fiber. Scanning of the focal point is also demonstrated by digital means. Effects from illumination and fiber bending are addressed.},
