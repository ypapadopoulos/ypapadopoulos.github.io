 abstract = {We present a novel design that exploits the focusing properties of scattering media to increase the resolution and the working distance of multimode fiber based imaging devices. Placing a highly scattering medium in front of the distal tip of the multimode fiber enables the formation of smaller sized foci at increased working distances away from the fiber tip. We perform a parametric study of the effect of the working distance and the separation between the fiber and the scattering medium on the focus size. We experimentally demonstrate submicron focused spots as far away as 800\Î¼\m with 532nm light.},
