abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate an ultra-thin rigid endoscope
  (450 Î¼m diameter) based on a passive multimode optical fiber. We use digital phase
  conjugation to overcome the modal scrambling of the fiber to tightly focus and scan
  the laser light at its distal end. By exploiting the maximum number of modes available,
  sub-micron resolution, high quality fluorescence images of neuronal cells were acquired.
  The imaging system is evaluated in terms of fluorescence collection efficiency,
  resolution and field of view. The small diameter of the proposed endoscope, along
  with its high quality images offer an opportunity for minimally invasive medical
  endoscopic imaging and diagnosis based on cellular phenotype via direct tissue penetration.
