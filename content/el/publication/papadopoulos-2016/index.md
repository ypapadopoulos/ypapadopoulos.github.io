abstract: A long-standing goal in biomedical imaging, the control of light inside
  turbid media, requires knowledge of how the phase and amplitude of an illuminating
  wavefront are transformed as the electric field propagates inside a scattering sample
  onto a target plane. So far, it has proved challenging to non-invasively characterize
  the scattered optical wavefront inside a disordered medium. Here, we present a non-invasive
  scattering compensation method, termed F-SHARP, which allows us to measure the scattered
  electric-field point spread function (E-field PSF) in three dimensions. Knowledge
  of the phase and amplitude of the E-field PSF makes it possible to optically cancel
  sample turbulence. We demonstrate the imaging capabilities of this technique on
  a variety of samples and notably through vertebrate brains and across thinned skull
  in vivo.
