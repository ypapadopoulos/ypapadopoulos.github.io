## Who We Are

We are a research group at the intersection of physics, optics, and biomedicine. Our work focuses on how light interacts with complex biological media, with the goal of advancing imaging and sensing technologies.

We value clarity, collaboration, and curiosity. Whether working on optical experiments or developing computational tools, we aim to combine fundamental insight with practical relevance.

## Our Research

Our current efforts span several areas of biophotonics:

- **Wavefront shaping and microscopy**: Techniques to focus light through scattering tissue and improve optical access in biological samples.
- **Miniature biosensing**: Developing compact optical sensors for potential use in wearable and mobile devices.
- **Computational imaging**: Using algorithmic approaches to enhance image reconstruction and analysis.

We aim to contribute tools and methods that can support biomedical research and healthcare applications.

## Join Us

We welcome interest from students, collaborators, and anyone curious about light and life.
