We are excited to announce that our research group has been awarded a new grant as part of the *Horizon Europe WIDERA Hop On* initiative. Through this funding, we will be joining the consortium of the **STIMULUS** project, contributing our expertise to advance its interdisciplinary goals.

The STIMULUS project consortium develops new non-invasive, convenient, low-cost and easy-to-use imaging technology that can measure new digital biomarkers from microcirculation for early detection of cardiovascular diseases. The novel technology will enable earlier detection of heart failure and chronic kidney disease, which will substantially decrease cardiovascular events in the European population.

The Biophotonics Research Group at NTUA will contribute through a dedicated Work Package focused on advancing miniature laser-based biosensors for hemodynamic measurements, with the goal of integrating this technology into consumer electronic devices.

In connection with this new collaboration, **we will soon be opening new research positions** to support our work on STIMULUS. Details will be posted on our website shortly.
