We are excited to announce that our research group has been awarded a new grant as part of the *Horizon Europe WIDERA Hop On* initiative. Through this funding, we will be joining the consortium of the **STIMULUS** project, contributing our expertise to advance its interdisciplinary goals.

The STIMULUS project consortium develops new non-invasive, convenient, low-cost and easy-to-use imaging technology that can measure new digital biomarkers from microcirculation for early detection of cardiovascular diseases. The novel technology will enable earlier detection of heart failure and chronic kidney disease, which will substantially decrease cardiovascular events in the European population.

The Biophotonics Research Group @ NTUA will be contributing with a separate Work Package focusing on the further development of miniature laser based biosensors for hemodynamics measurements.
