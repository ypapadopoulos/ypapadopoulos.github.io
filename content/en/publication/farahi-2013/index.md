abstract: Multimode fiber endoscopes have recently been shown to provide sub-micrometer
  resolution, however, imaging through a multimode fiber is highly sensitive to bending.
  Here we describe the implementation of a coherent beacon source placed at the distal
  tip of the multimode fiber, which can be used to compensate for the effects of bending.
  In the first part of this paper, we show that a diffraction limited focused spot
  can be generated at the distal tip of the multimode fiber using the beacon. In the
  second part, we demonstrate focusing even when the fiber is bent by dynamically
  compensating for it. The speckle pattern at the proximal fiber end, generated by
  the beacon source placed at its distal end, is highly dependent on the fiber conformation.
  We experimentally show that by intensity correlation, it is possible to identify
  the fiber conformation and maintain a focus spot while the fiber is bent over a
  certain range. Once the fiber configuration is determined, previously calibrated
  phase patterns could be stored for each fiber conformation and used to scan the
  distal spot and perform imaging.
