 abstract = {The optical memory effect is a well-known type of wave correlation that is observed in coherent fields that scatter through thin and diffusive materials, like biological tissue. It is a fundamental physical property of scattering media that can be harnessed for deep-tissue microscopy or 'through-the-wall' imaging applications. Here we show that the optical memory effect is a special case of a far more general class of wave correlation. Our new theoretical framework explains how waves remain correlated over both space and angle when they are jointly shifted and tilted inside scattering media of arbitrary geometry. We experimentally demonstrate the existence of such coupled correlations and describe how they can be used to optimize the scanning range in adaptive optics microscopes.},
