abstract: Optical microscopy is an indispensable tool in biomedical sciences, but
  its reach in deep tissues is limited due to aberrations and scattering. This problem
  can be overcome by wavefront-shaping techniques, albeit at limited fields of view
  (FOVs). Inspired by astronomical imaging, conjugate wavefront shaping can lead to
  an increased field of view in microscopy, but this correction is limited to a set
  depth and cannot be dynamically adapted. Here, we present a conjugate wavefront-shaping
  scheme based on focus scanning holographic aberration probing (F-SHARP). We combine
  it with a compact implementation that can be readily adapted to a variety of commercial
  and home-built two-photon microscopes. We demonstrate the power of the method by
  imaging with high resolution over extended FOV (>80 µm) deeper than 400 μm inside
  a mouse brain through a thinned skull.
