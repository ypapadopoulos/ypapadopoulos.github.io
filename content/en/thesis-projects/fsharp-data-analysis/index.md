**Description:**  
The student will analyze experimental data obtained using the F-SHARP (Focus Scanning Holographic Aberration Probing) method from fluorescent neurons in the brain tissue of _Danionella translucida_. The goal is to process and analyze the data to extract quantitative information on the improvement of optical focusing in scattering media.

**Required Knowledge:**  
- Understanding basic concepts of optical microscopy and laser propagation in tissues  
- Programming in Matlab or Python  
- Data analysis and visualization  

**Suggested Bibliography:**

- Papadopoulos, I. N. et al. _Dynamic conjugate F-SHARP microscopy_. Light: Science and Applications (2020).
