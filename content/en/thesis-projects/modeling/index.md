**Description:**  
Students will develop a model for coherent light (laser) propagation through scattering media such as biological tissues, utilizing Fourier optics techniques and computational models. The aim is to predict light scattering and signal using machine learning (ML) and neural networks (NN), with applications in optical imaging and therapy.

**Required Knowledge:**  
- Programming in Matlab or Python  
- Basic knowledge of ML / neural networks  
- Fundamentals of optics and optical propagation  

**Suggested Bibliography:**

- Kamilov*, U. S. & Papadopoulos*, I.N. _Learning approach to optical tomography_. Optica (2015).
