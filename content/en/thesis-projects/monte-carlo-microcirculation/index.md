**Description:**  
This project focuses on simulating laser light propagation in the superficial layers of the circulatory system (e.g., capillaries, veins). Students will apply the Monte-Carlo method to understand how light interacts with blood and tissues, aiming at applications in optical diagnostics and phototherapy.

**Required Knowledge:**  
- Programming (Matlab or Python)  
- Physics of light propagation in scattering media  
- Introduction to Monte-Carlo methods  

**Suggested Bibliography:**  
- Wang, L., Jacques, S. L., & Zheng, L. _MCMLâ€”Monte Carlo modeling of light transport in multi-layered tissues_ (1995).  
- Tuchin, V. V. _Tissue Optics: Light Scattering Methods and Instruments for Medical Diagnosis_ (2015).
