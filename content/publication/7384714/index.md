abstract: Optical tomographic imaging requires an accurate forward model as well as
  regularization to mitigate missing-data artifacts and to suppress noise. Nonlinear
  forward models can provide more accurate interpretation of the measured data than
  their linear counterparts, but they generally result in computationally prohibitive
  reconstruction algorithms. Although sparsity-driven regularizers significantly improve
  the quality of reconstructed image, they further increase the computational burden
  of imaging. In this paper, we present a novel iterative imaging method for optical
  tomography that combines a nonlinear forward model based on the beam propagation
  method (BPM) with an edge-preserving three-dimensional (3-D) total variation (TV)
  regularizer. The central element of our approach is a time-reversal scheme, which
  allows for an efficient computation of the derivative of the transmitted wave-field
  with respect to the distribution of the refractive index. This time-reversal scheme
  together with our stochastic proximal-gradient algorithm makes it possible to optimize
  under a nonlinear forward model in a computationally tractable way, thus enabling
  a high-quality imaging of the refractive index throughout the object. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our method through several experiments on simulated and experimentally
  measured data.
