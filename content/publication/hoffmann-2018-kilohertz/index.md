abstract: The controlled modulation of an optical wavefront is required for aberration
  correction, digital phase conjugation or patterned photostimulation. For most of
  these applications it is desirable to control the wavefront modulation at the highest
  rates possible. The digital micromirror device (DMD) presents a cost-effective solution
  to achieve high-speed modulation and often exceeds the speed of the more conventional
  liquid crystal spatial light modulator, but is inherently an amplitude modulator.
  Furthermore, spatial dispersion caused by DMD diffraction complicates its use with
  pulsed laser sources, such as those used in nonlinear microscopy. Here we introduce
  a DMD-based optical design that overcomes these limitations and achieves dispersion-free
  high-speed binary phase modulation. We show that this phase modulation can be used
  to switch through binary phase patterns at the rate of 20 kHz in two-photon excitation
  fluorescence applications.
