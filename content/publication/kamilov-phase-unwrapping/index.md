abstract: In this paper, we propose a new technique for two-dimensional phase unwrapping.
  The unwrapped phase is found as the solution of an inverse problem that consists
  in the minimization of an energy functional. The latter includes a weighted data-fidelity
  term that favors sparsity in the error between the true and wrapped phase differences,
  as well as a regularizer based on higher-order total-variation. One desirable feature
  of our method is its rotation invariance, which allows it to unwrap a much larger
  class of images compared to the state of the art. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our method through several experiments on simulated and real data obtained through
  the tomographic phase microscope. The proposed method can enhance the applicability
  and outreach of techniques that rely on quantitative phase evaluation.
