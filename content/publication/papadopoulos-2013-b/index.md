abstract: We demonstrate Optical-Resolution Photoacoustic Microscopy (OR-PAM), where
  the optical field is focused and scanned using Digital Phase Conjugation through
  a multimode fiber. The focus is scanned across the field of view using digital means,
  and the acoustic signal induced is collected by a transducer. Optical-resolution
  photoacoustic images of a knot made by two absorptive wires are obtained and we
  report on resolution smaller than 1.5 μm across a 201 μm × 201 μm field of view.
  The use of a multimode optical fiber for the optical excitation part can pave the
  way for miniature endoscopes that can provide optical-resolution photoacoustic images
  at large optical depth. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.
