abstract: We present a novel design that exploits the focusing properties of scattering
  media to increase the resolution and the working distance of multimode fiber based
  imaging devices. Placing a highly scattering medium in front of the distal tip of
  the multimode fiber enables the formation of smaller sized foci at increased working
  distances away from the fiber tip. We perform a parametric study of the effect of
  the working distance and the separation between the fiber and the scattering medium
  on the focus size. We experimentally demonstrate submicron focused spots as far
  away as 800Î¼m with 532nm light.
