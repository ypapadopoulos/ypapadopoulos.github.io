 abstract = {Optical microscopy is an indispensable tool in biomedical sciences, but its reach in deep tissues is limited due to aberrations and scattering. This problem can be overcome by wavefront-shaping techniques, albeit at limited fields of view (FOVs). Inspired by astronomical imaging, conjugate wavefront shaping can lead to an increased field of view in microscopy, but this correction is limited to a set depth and cannot be dynamically adapted. Here, we present a conjugate wavefront-shaping scheme based on focus scanning holographic aberration probing (F-SHARP). We combine it with a compact implementation that can be readily adapted to a variety of commercial and home-built two-photon microscopes. We demonstrate the power of the method by imaging with high resolution over extended FOV (>80 µm) deeper than 400 μm inside a mouse brain through a thinned skull.},
