# 📚 Documentation Folder (`/docs/`)

This folder contains internal documentation for the Hugo project setup, structure, and maintenance.

These guides are intended for project contributors, editors, and administrators.

They are **not published** publicly on the website, but are kept version-controlled within the project repository.

## 📋 Available Documentation

- **how-to-add-courses.md**  
  Instructions for creating a new course page, uploading images, setting up metadata, and ensuring multilingual support.

## 🚀 Usage Guidelines

- Always keep documentation **up to date** when the project structure changes.
- Write in simple, clear Markdown.
- Prefer short, numbered instructions whenever possible.
- Use emoji icons (✅, 📚, 🚀) sparingly for clarity and easy scanning.
- Include code blocks (`yaml`, `html`, etc.) where needed.

## ❓ Why `/docs/`?

- Ensures long-term maintainability
- Helps onboard new collaborators faster
- Reduces technical debt
- Provides a self-explanatory project structure

# 📣 Important

Documentation is for **internal project management only**.

If public documentation is needed in the future (e.g., user guides), it should be placed under `/content/` in a dedicated "Documentation" section.
