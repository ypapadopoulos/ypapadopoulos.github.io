Wavefront shaping techniques are able to overcome this problem in principle, but are often slow and their performance depends on the sample. This greatly reduces their practicability for biological applications. Here we present a scattering compensation technique based on three-photon (3P) excitation, which converges faster than comparable two-photon (2P) techniques and works reliably even on densely labeled samples, where 2P approaches fail. To demonstrate its usability and advantages for biomedical imaging we apply it to the imaging of dendritic spines on GFP-labeled layer 5 neurons in an anesthetized mouse.","tags":null,"title":"Deep tissue scattering compensation with three-photon F-SHARP","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Γιάννης Παπαδόπουλος","Jean Sebastien Jouhanneau","Naoya Takahashi","David Kaplan","Matthew Larkum","James Poulet","Benjamin Judkewitz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"el","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"417cd48cac3c8b045b1f67cf3c21cb19","permalink":"https://biophotonics.physics.ntua.gr/el/publication/papadopoulos-2020/","publishdate":"2025-05-07T10:25:01.000502Z","relpermalink":"/el/publication/papadopoulos-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Optical microscopy is an indispensable tool in biomedical sciences, but its reach in deep tissues is limited due to aberrations and scattering. This problem can be overcome by wavefront-shaping techniques, albeit at limited fields of view (FOVs). Inspired by astronomical imaging, conjugate wavefront shaping can lead to an increased field of view in microscopy, but this correction is limited to a set depth and cannot be dynamically adapted. Here, we present a conjugate wavefront-shaping scheme based on focus scanning holographic aberration probing (F-SHARP). We combine it with a compact implementation that can be readily adapted to a variety of commercial and home-built two-photon microscopes.

Wavefront shaping is one of the most promising ways to mitigate scattering and focus through inhomogeneous samples. However, wavefront correction remains accurate over only a limited spatial extent within the scattering medium - a correlation range referred to as the optical memory effect. Here, by selecting only the weakly scattered light for wavefront shaping, we show that the addition of temporal degrees of freedom enhances this correlation range. We investigate spatial scattering correlations by digitally time-gating the early arriving light in the spectral domain. We demonstrate that the range of the translational memory effect for the early arriving light is increased almost fourfold, paving the way for a range of scattering media imaging applications.","tags":["Coherence imaging","Forward scattering","Imaging through turbid media","Inhomogeneous optical media","Light propagation","Medical imaging","Multiple scattering","Scattering media","Speckle patterns"],"title":"Scattering correlations of time-gated light","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maximilian Hoffmann","Γιάννης Παπαδόπουλος","Benjamin Judkewitz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"el","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"5a8d340e187a0d161c237318b17dc81b","permalink":"https://biophotonics.physics.ntua.gr/el/publication/hoffmann-2018-kilohertz/","publishdate":"2025-05-07T10:25:01.047203Z","relpermalink":"/el/publication/hoffmann-2018-kilohertz/","section":"publication","summary":"The controlled modulation of an optical wavefront is required for aberration correction, digital phase conjugation or patterned photostimulation.

Furthermore, spatial dispersion caused by DMD diffraction complicates its use with pulsed laser sources, such as those used in nonlinear microscopy.

In this paper, we present a novel iterative imaging method for optical tomography that combines a nonlinear forward model based on the beam propagation method (BPM) with an edge-preserving three-dimensional (3-D) total variation (TV) regularizer. The central element of our approach is a time-reversal scheme, which allows for an efficient computation of the derivative of the transmitted wave-field with respect to the distribution of the refractive index. This time-reversal scheme together with our stochastic proximal-gradient algorithm makes it possible to optimize under a nonlinear forward model in a computationally tractable way, thus enabling a high-quality imaging of the refractive index throughout the object.

Recently, multimode fibers have provided a new paradigm for minimally invasive endoscopic imaging by controlling light propagation through them. Here we introduce a combined imaging technique where confocal images are acquired through a multimode fiber. We achieve this by digitally engineering the excitation wavefront and then applying a virtual digital pinhole on the collected signal. In this way, we are able to acquire images through the fiber with significantly increased contrast. With a fiber of numerical aperture 0.22, we achieve a lateral resolution of 1.5µm, and an axial resolution of 12.7µm.

In previous work, the correction of such distortions using various wavefront control methods has been demonstrated in the continuous wave case. However, in the ultra-fast pulse regime, modal dispersion temporally broadens a pulse after propagation. Here, we present a method that compensates for spatial distortions and mitigates temporal broadening due to modal dispersion by a selective phase conjugation process in which only modes of similar group velocities are excited. The selectively excited modes are forced to follow certain paths through the multimode fiber and interfere constructively at the distal tip to form a focused spot with minimal temporal broadening. We demonstrate the delivery of focused 500 fs pulses through a 30 cm long step-index multimode fiber. The achieved pulse duration corresponds to approximately 1/30th of the duration obtained if modal dispersion was not controlled. Moreover, we measured a detailed two-dimensional map of the pulse duration at the output of the fiber and confirmed that the focused spot produces a two-photon absorption effect.
